# data_structures

OCaml library with various functional data structures. Currently mostly heap-based priority queues.

For now, there is only partial laziness-based amortization, but I am planning on covering at least Okasaki's textbook.

For sorting, `BottomUpMergeSort` collections are about as efficient as the standard library's `List.sort`.
